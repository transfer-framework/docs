Installation

We use Sphinx to build our documentation.

Before you start, be sure to install our version of Sphinx:

pip install git+https://github.com/valisj/sphinxcontrib-fulltoc
```

Building
--------

Run the following command to build the documentation in HTML format:

```
make html
```

Then, open `_build/html/index.html` in your browser.
